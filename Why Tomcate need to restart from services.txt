Restarting the Apache Tomcat service in PowerCurves is often necessary for several reasons:

Configuration Changes: When you make changes to the configuration files (like server.xml or web.xml), a restart is required for the changes to take effect1.

Deployment of New Applications: If you deploy new applications or update existing ones, restarting Tomcat ensures that the new code is loaded properly1.

Memory Leaks: Over time, applications running on Tomcat might cause memory leaks. Restarting the service can help clear these leaks and improve performance1.

Performance Issues: If the server is experiencing performance issues or is unresponsive, a restart can help resolve these problems by clearing the current state and starting fresh1.

Updates and Patches: Applying updates or patches to Tomcat or the underlying operating system might require a restart to ensure all changes are applied correctly1.
